# ViewFinder

This project is an _example_ of a completed ViewFinder project for KWK Level 2 Swift camp. Students will have creative freedom over app icon, placeholder images, navigation/icons, and a home view (if desired). 

Instructors will be provided with the complete project as an example, including branches for each complete iteration according to the project outline (starting on [Day 7](https://github.com/turingschool-projects/kwk-level3-swift/tree/master/sessions)).
